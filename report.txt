Historial Data Insights and Solutions(only one user present in this dataset):
    - The student should focus on human reproduction more, take more quizes, do more revision because only one quiz is taken on this topic.
    
    - quizes and exams are not taken for most of the topics in a span of 40 days. (again taking more quizes is recommended)

    - percentages are dropping continuously for topics "body fuilds and circulation" and "reproductive health". reason could be the student has gotten overconfident as in the beginning he scored well.

    - reproductive health is a topic in which this student is better than average as he takes less time and achieves more accuracy.

    - only one quiz is taken on "microbes in human welfare" and the performance is fantastic, so this topic could be skipped and more focus can be on other topics.
